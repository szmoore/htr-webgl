		<ol>
			<li> You can climb the walls and jump off at any height </li>
			<li> Squish foxes by tricking them into jumping into a falling box </li>
			<li> You can increase fall speed with the <em>down</em> arrow </li>
			<li> Fall on a Fox that is facing downwards to put it to sleep (risky)</li>
			<li> Sleeping foxes don't wake up unless pushed. So just don't push them. </li>
			<li> Try and kill each fox before the next one appears, when they accumulate it gets hard very fast </li>
			<li> Sideways collisions with boxes are not fatal </li>
			<li> Any collision that is not fatal allows you to jump again </li>
			<li> You can jump in mid air once after hitting an object </li>
