		<h1> Hint One </h1>
		<p> Do not use a phone or touch screen. It will probably not work. </p>
		<p> It is a computer game, even though it in theory works on a phone. </p>

		<h1> Hint Two </h1>
		<p> It is supposed to be hard. Didn't you ever play flappy bird? </p>
		
		<h1> How to not die quite as fast </h1>
		<ol>
			<li> You can climb the walls and jump off at any height </li>
			<li> Squish foxes by tricking them into jumping into a falling box </li>
			<li> You can increase fall speed with the <em>down</em> arrow </li>
			<li> Fall on a Fox that is facing downwards to put it to sleep (risky)</li>
			<li> Sleeping foxes don't wake up unless pushed. So just don't push them. </li>
			<li> Try and kill each fox before the next one appears, when they accumulate it gets hard very fast </li>
			<li> Sideways collisions with boxes are not fatal </li>
			<li> Any collision that is not fatal allows you to jump again </li>
			<li> You can jump in mid air once after hitting an object </li>
		</ol>

	<p> Complain about how hard it is to me on <a href="https://github.com/szmoore/htr-webgl/issues/new">github</a> and maybe I'll fix it, but probably not. </p>
